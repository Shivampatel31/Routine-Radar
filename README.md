Routine Radar is a Python script designed to send automated notifications to help you manage your daily tasks and reminders. It sends reminders at specific times throughout the day to encourage healthy habits such as drinking water, taking breaks, and staying on track with work.

The script runs continuously and checks the current time to notify the user about tasks like lunch, snacks, water intake, and even sleep reminders. It leverages the plyer library to deliver notifications, ensuring you never forget essential activities during your busy day.
